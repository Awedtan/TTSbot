# TTSbot

Everything here is super outdated and shouldn't be listened to i will maybe fix later

A 200% original discord.js bot rewritten in discord.js-commando

Has text-to-speech and midi synthesizing commands

Music commands can be found at https://github.com/Awedtan/Newbot

Disclaimer: I've modified my version of discord.js commando to stop the bot from constantly pinging people. If something doesn't work properly let me know

### TTS voices

Depending on your OS, the voices you have available and the way you add them will be different (see https://www.npmjs.com/package/say). 

On windows 10, voices are added through Settings > Time & Language > Speech > Manage voices

The list of voices available for use will be printed to the console on startup
